INTRODUCTION                                    *looks*

This plugin provides a way of managing various looks of vim (works much better
with gvim) which you can switch between with a single command or (optionally)
a map.

DEFINING LOOKS                                  *looks-define*

Looks are defined in dictionary set to a global variable called g:looks. It
looks something like this (should be inside your vimrc or sourced otherwise)
>
    let g:looks = {}
    let g:looks.dark = {
        \ '_map': "d",
        \ ':colorscheme': "lucius",
        \ '&guifont': "Inconsolata\\ Medium\\ 15",
        \ '&cursorline': 1
        \ }
    let g:looks.light = { ":colorscheme": "tango" }
<

The above defines two looks, namely "dark" and "lite". You can load a look
with the following command
>
    :Look <look-name>
<
Where <look-name> is either "dark" or "lite" or any other look as you might
have defined.

The first character in the keys in each look dictionary describes what kind of
an option the key denotes. Currently 3 kinds of options are supported:

    & - vim options. Run as "let key=value".
    : - vim commands. As if run on the command line.
    _ - options for looks plugin. Currently only "_map" is available.

You can define as many looks as you want. As you can see, each look is nothing
but a simple |Dictionary| whose keys are nothing but vim
options/commands/settings. Not all vim options are looked for, if you want an
option to be supported by looks, please contact me or add it yourself by
looking at the source of looks.vim.

Note that boolean options like "cursorline" and "cursorcolumn" should be set
to 1 or 0 meaning, to turn on or off respectively.

Also note that all keys inside a look are optional. You can give an empty
dictionary for a look.

If a look has a "_map" key inside it, then that look can be loaded using the
normal mode command "<Leader>od" where "d" is the value of the "_map" key and
"o" is the value of "g:looks_map_prefix" (which defaults to "o"). You can set
g:looks_map_prefix to anything in your vimrc, even an empty string :).

CHANGE LOG                                          *looks-changelog*

0.3: Can now handle (presumably) all vim commands and options. Changed look
dictionary format in an incompatible way to allow setting of any option.
Thanks Salman Halim.

0.2: Added support for _map to have mappings to load individual looks.
